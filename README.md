Playground plugin, several new ships and outfits, not focused on adding content to vanilla galaxy so much of it is unavailable without an all-content plugin.

Can be considered new game plus as only the content clostest to vanilla quality is available in-game, however probably not at its' current state. All outfits and ships are available using my all-content plugin, or adding the shipyard and outfitter manually to a planet.
