planet Arx
	description "This ringworld is more than half completed, with no sign of construction slowing down for even a second. The product of millennia of concentrated construction effort which has consumed nearly every other stellar object in this system just to provide the raw materials."
	description "Apparently even the Irms' home planet is being picked clean to contribute to this astronomical build. Undeniably this is a huge leap for what appears to be a single star system species."

	spaceport "Each completed section of the ring is open and ready for business already. This is a testament to just how much anticipation the Irm hold for their new home."
	spaceport "The inside of the ring is a looping ribbon world with direct sunlight beaming down on the inhabitants. Solar power is still collected, just maybe not in such massive amounts as would be expected from a station completely wrapping around a systems star."
planet Atrapos
	bribe 0
	description "A barren world that appears devoid of any life in all but a select few areas. Atrapos is secluded enough from any great civilization to be an untapped paradise but unfortunately and mysteriously is not, rather on the brink of being uninhabitable indefinately."
	description "The air is breathable, but it is fatally toxic on near all of the surface of this planet because of extreme levels of radioactivity. Unrelentling waves of radioaction sweep the surface bringing death to anything it crosses paths with."
