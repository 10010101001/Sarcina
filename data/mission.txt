"We have heard of your efforts defending the planet of Allhome and we are honoured," says a rather elderly Hai, "but as we have business to discuss I will skip the formalities." Saying somewhat resigned, as though discussing hostilities causes them great distress, "Recently we have learnt of the source of these attacks, joint warlords that go by Gnar and Gash, they control the unfettered planet of Stormhold," now with even more resignation in its' voice, "Usually we deal with our situations internally however human space is outside of our jurisdiction, and I'm afraid several of our largest warships would stir up quite a panic. We regret to send you alone to deal with our matters given the risk, but we will compensate you greatly for your efforts."`
