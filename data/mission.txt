			`	Being lead through a series of hallways and around several bends, you have trouble visualising the exact way you and the Hai arrived here. Stopping at a large doorway you are told that beyond this door is the chamber of the elders.`
			`	Entering the chamber you are greeted with a larger audience than you were expecting. "We have heard of your efforts defending the planet of Allhome and we are honoured," says a rather elderly Hai, "but as we have business to discuss I will skip the formalities." Saying somewhat resigned, as though discussing hostilities causes them great distress, "Recently we have learnt of the source of these attacks, joint warlords that go by Gnar and Gash, they control the unfettered planet of Stormhold," now with even more resignation in its' voice, "Usually we deal with our situations internally however human space is outside of our jurisdiction, and I'm afraid several of our largest warships would stir up quite a panic. We regret to send you alone to deal with our matters given the risk, but we will compensate you greatly for your efforts."`

			`Suddenly you notice a massive rush in the spaceport: "We are under attack! <planet> is under attack by the unfettered humans! We need every combat-worthy ship to join in the defenses!" The authorities will probably be very gracious, but this could also be an easy way to get yourself killed.`
