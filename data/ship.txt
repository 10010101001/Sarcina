	description "The Aphid is a light freighter designed by the hai, but is also in production by the reavers. The Aphid may have been designed with hauling cargo in mind but this iteration took a complete turn in the fiercest possible way. A considerably stronger hull with an improved shield matrix, sporting three gun ports comes the lightest warship of choice, the Adel."
