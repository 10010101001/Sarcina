	description "The Aphid is a light freighter designed by the hai, but is also in production by the reavers. The Aphid may have been designed with hauling cargo in mind but this iteration took a complete turn in the fiercest possible way. A considerably stronger hull with an improved shield matrix, sporting three gun ports comes the lightest warship of choice, the Adel."

	description "The largest Irm ship in production, and one of the only. The Irms' focus on utilizing their resources to their full potential all collate on this monstrosity. A super capital ship with an impressive 16 drone bays is all the fearsome deterrant the Irm need, in the case they are discovered and met with hostility of course."

	description "Why Syndicate engineers decided to take to the workshop with the Protector one more time is a mystery. This monstrosity is even closer to a defense platform than the Protecter as it packs on more turrets, and 'boasts' even less manuverability. It relies on nothing more than the concentrated firepower from over six blaster turrets mounted on its' reinforced frame. This warship serves as a rear guard to any fleet, simply because it cannot keep up with the fleeing merchants it's often employed to protect."

	description "The Leviathan has been a choice capital ship for centuries, long before the republic. Far outdated but still highly sought after, the Leviathan still outperforms certain modern day models, even if it is clunky by todays standards. Hydra is a long needed step up from the centuries old relic, generously provided with a sturdier hull and improved shield matrix."
